# QTripStatic

QTripStatic is a static travel website project built as part of my web development learning path.I focused on building and refining the frontend structure to ensure responsiveness, accessibility, and a seamless user experience across devices.

## 🛠️ What I Did This Month

- ✅ Designed and implemented** a fully responsive UI using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5.
- ✅ Created modular components** (navbar, footer, cards) for consistency across pages
- ✅ Developed core pages**: Home, Adventure Listing, Adventure Details, and Reservation Confirmation
- ✅ Tested layout across multiple screen sizes to ensure mobile-first responsiveness
- ✅ Deployed the site using Netlify, with automatic CI/CD on each push to main branch
- ✅ Followed clean code practices and organised assets logically into `pages`, `styles`, `images`, and `scripts` folders
